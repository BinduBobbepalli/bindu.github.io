About Project-


***Learn Anytime, Anywhere. 
Accelerate Your Future***
***SKILL- means an ability and capacity acquired through deliberate, systematic, and sustained effort to smoothly and adaptively carryout complex activities or job functions involving ideas (cognitive skills), things (technical skills), and/or people (interpersonal skills)***.
*We believe everyone has the capacity to be creative. Skill is a place where people develop their own potential.
* Many organizations offer professional development courses or other free training to people interested in growing their skills.
You can find opportunities to learn skills on the job by asking your manager or connecting with your employer's human resources department in this SKILL STARTER.
this SKILL STARTER is providing the following opportunities for the students: 
   *Artificial intelligence. You don't need to work in the artificial intelligence (AI) field to expect to *encounter AI in your workplace.
   *Coding.
   *Cloud computing.
   *Blockchain.
   *UX design. 
   *Critical thinking.
   *Emotional intelligence. 
   *Communication.
***Research has found there are three basic categories of skills in the world:
   *knowledges, transferable skills and self-management skills.
   *A novice understanding of the skill. 
You have exposure to the skill and understand basic concepts, but you lack experience. For transparency, there's nothing wrong with writing “beginner” in parentheses next to the skill. Intermediate: Between a beginner and an expert. 
***The objectives of Basic Skills Training are to enable unemployed or marginally employed adults to acquire: 
   *literacy
   *numeracy
   *employability 
skills necessary to function in entry-level employment or acquire the prerequisites for further employment-related training, and. competencies at the Grade 7-9 levels. 
*Skills training also is important. because it enhances overall job satisfaction. 
Top performers often crave challenges and new opportunities. By providing them with access to upskilling opportunities, their engagement and overall company loyalty will likely increase. 
The most common approach to skills development is training current workers (employees and partners) to acquire the knowledge they need to do the necessary skills. This includes:
   *Upskilling
   *cross-skilling
   *and reskilling
**These are the six skills your young adult will need no matter what their career path: 
   *Communication.
