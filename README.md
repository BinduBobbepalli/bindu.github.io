***SKILL***


This is my Future Ready Talent Project


About Project-


***Learn Anytime, Anywhere. 
Accelerate Your Future***

***SKILL- means an ability and capacity acquired through deliberate, systematic, and sustained effort to smoothly and adaptively carryout complex activities or job functions involving ideas (cognitive skills), things (technical skills), and/or people (interpersonal skills)***.


*We believe everyone has the capacity to be creative. Skill is a place where people develop their own potential.

* Many organizations offer professional development courses or other free training to people interested in growing their skills.
* 
You can find opportunities to learn skills on the job by asking your manager or connecting with your employer's human resources department in this SKILL STARTER.
this SKILL STARTER is providing the following opportunities for the students: 

   *Artificial intelligence. You don't need to work in the artificial intelligence (AI) field to expect to *encounter AI in your workplace.
   
   *Coding.
   
   *Cloud computing.
   
   *Blockchain.
   
   *UX design. 
   
   *Critical thinking.
   
   *Emotional intelligence.
   
   *Communication.
   
***Research has found there are three basic categories of skills in the world:

   *knowledges, transferable skills and self-management skills.
   *A novice understanding of the skill.
   
You have exposure to the skill and understand basic concepts, but you lack experience. For transparency, there's nothing wrong with writing “beginner” in parentheses next to the skill. Intermediate: Between a beginner and an expert. 

***The objectives of Basic Skills Training are to enable unemployed or marginally employed adults to acquire: 
   *literacy
   *numeracy
   *employability 
   
skills necessary to function in entry-level employment or acquire the prerequisites for further employment-related training, and. competencies at the Grade 7-9 levels. 
*Skills training also is important. because it enhances overall job satisfaction. 
Top performers often crave challenges and new opportunities. By providing them with access to upskilling opportunities, their engagement and overall company loyalty will likely increase.

The most common approach to skills development is training current workers (employees and partners) to acquire the knowledge they need to do the necessary skills. This includes:
   *Upskilling
   *cross-skilling
   *and reskilling
   
**These are the six skills your young adult will need no matter what their career path: 
   *Communication. 
   *Teamwork and collaboration.
   *Professionalism.
   *Self-management and initiative.
   *Critical and creative thinking.
   *Global fluency and perspective.
   
   
the servies that i used in azure are:

**STATIC WEB PPS and VISUAL STUDIO CODE**

static web app-A static site is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It requires no server-side (also called back-end) processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.by this static web app service , I created a website SKILL.

visual studio code-Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE. Edit, build, and debug with ease#
At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more.by this visual studo code service ,I created a website with respective coding languages like java etc





Step 1: Work on your project and push it to GitHub
 

Step 2: Create an Azure Static Web App and this step automatically generates a GitHub workflow that will always initiate deployment every time you push changes to your repository.

* Creating the Static Web App instantly generates the .yml workflow file for you in GitHub


Step 1: Work on your project on VS Code


Step 2: Install the Azure Account & Azure App Service Extensions on your editor, then sign into your Azure Account


Step 3: Create a new web app and deploy your project, all this while you are still on your editor

Azure Static Web Apps for Visual Studio Code
Use this extension to quickly create and manage Azure Static Web Apps directly from VS Code.

Visit the wiki for additional information about the extension.

Sign up today for your free Azure account and receive 12 months of free popular services, $200 free credit and 25+ always free services 👉 Start Free.

Run and debug your static web app
Debug static web app with a dynamic configuration

✨ Check out Guide: Debugging a Static Web App with VS Code for instructions and more information about debugging a static web app.

Create your first static web app
Click the '+' button in the explorer to setup a new static web app

Create Static Web App

Select "Create Static Web App..."

Create Static Web App

Authorize access to your GitHub account so the extension can find your repositories

Authorize Access to through GitHub

Authorize Access to through GitHub

Select a repository and branch that will be deployed to the static web app

If your local project has a remote configured, the extension will default to that repository

Provide the app folder name

Location of your application code. For example, '/' represents the root of your app, while '/app' represents a directory called 'app'.

Provide the api folder name (optional)

Location of your Azure Functions code. For example, '/api' represents a folder called 'api'. If you don't have an Azure Functions project yet, don't worry! This is optional so just leave this blank.

Provide the build artifact folder name

The path of your build output relative to your apps location. For example, setting a value of 'build' when your app location is set to '/app' will cause the content at '/app/build' to be served.

✨ See recommended settings for popular frameworks and libraries

Updating your static web app
Commit and push your changes to the GitHub repository that your static web app is configured to. It will then use GitHub Actions to update your app.

If you create a pull request through GitHub, GitHub Actions will create a staging environment with your new changes live. Your Production environment and staging environments are all listed within your Static Web App as well as application settings.

IMPORTANT: The application settings only apply to the backend API of an Azure Static Web App.

Static Web App Environments

Create a HTTP Function for your static web app
You can add a serverless API to your static web app by creating a HTTP Functions project.

Open your static web app project in your Visual Studio Code workspace

Select the button to create a new HTTP Function

Create HTTP Function

Provide a HTTP Function name that is unique to your API

If this is your first HTTP Function, select a language for your API

Select Language

Telemetry
VS Code collects usage data and sends it to Microsoft to help improve our products and services. Read our privacy statement to learn more. If you don’t wish to send usage data to Microsoft, you can set the telemetry.enableTelemetry setting to false. Learn more in our FAQ.
