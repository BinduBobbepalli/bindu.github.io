***SKILL STARTER***


This is my Future Ready Talent Project


About Project-


***Learn Anytime, Anywhere. 
Accelerate Your Future***

***SKILL- means an ability and capacity acquired through deliberate, systematic, and sustained effort to smoothly and adaptively carryout complex activities or job functions involving ideas (cognitive skills), things (technical skills), and/or people (interpersonal skills)***.
*We believe everyone has the capacity to be creative. Skill is a place where people develop their own potential.
* Many organizations offer professional development courses or other free training to people interested in growing their skills.
You can find opportunities to learn skills on the job by asking your manager or connecting with your employer's human resources department in this SKILL STARTER.
this SKILL STARTER is providing the following opportunities for the students: 
   *Artificial intelligence. You don't need to work in the artificial intelligence (AI) field to expect to *encounter AI in your workplace.
   *Coding.
   *Cloud computing.
   *Blockchain.
   *UX design. 
   *Critical thinking.
   *Emotional intelligence. 
   *Communication.
***Research has found there are three basic categories of skills in the world:
   *knowledges, transferable skills and self-management skills.
   *A novice understanding of the skill. 
You have exposure to the skill and understand basic concepts, but you lack experience. For transparency, there's nothing wrong with writing “beginner” in parentheses next to the skill. Intermediate: Between a beginner and an expert. 
***The objectives of Basic Skills Training are to enable unemployed or marginally employed adults to acquire: 
   *literacy
   *numeracy
   *employability 
skills necessary to function in entry-level employment or acquire the prerequisites for further employment-related training, and. competencies at the Grade 7-9 levels. 
*Skills training also is important. because it enhances overall job satisfaction. 
Top performers often crave challenges and new opportunities. By providing them with access to upskilling opportunities, their engagement and overall company loyalty will likely increase. 
The most common approach to skills development is training current workers (employees and partners) to acquire the knowledge they need to do the necessary skills. This includes:
   *Upskilling
   *cross-skilling
   *and reskilling
**These are the six skills your young adult will need no matter what their career path: 
   *Communication. 
   *Teamwork and collaboration.
   *Professionalism.
   *Self-management and initiative.
   *Critical and creative thinking.
   *Global fluency and perspective.
the servies that i used in azure are:
**STATIC WEB PPS and VISUAL STUDIO CODE**
static web app-A static site is the most basic kind of website, and the easiest to create. It requires no server-side (also called back-end) processing, only client-side. Client-side technologies are HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.by this static web app service , I created a website SKILL.

visual studio code-Visual Studio Code is a streamlined code editor with support for development operations like debugging, task running, and version control. It aims to provide just the tools a developer needs for a quick code-build-debug cycle and leaves more complex workflows to fuller featured IDEs, such as Visual Studio IDE. Edit, build, and debug with ease#
At its heart, Visual Studio Code features a lightning fast source code editor, perfect for day-to-day use. With support for hundreds of languages, VS Code helps you be instantly productive with syntax highlighting, bracket-matching, auto-indentation, box-selection, snippets, and more.by this visual studo code service ,I created a website with respective coding languages like java etc

Step 1: Work on your project and push it to GitHub
 

Step 2: Create an Azure Static Web App and this step automatically generates a GitHub workflow that will always initiate deployment every time you push changes to your repository.

* Creating the Static Web App instantly generates the .yml workflow file for you in GitHub

Step 1: Work on your project on VS Code

Step 2: Install the Azure Account & Azure App Service Extensions on your editor, then sign into your Azure Account

Step 3: Create a new web app and deploy your project, all this while you are still on your editor

All you do is push your project change on GitHub and Azure handles the rest. (Sweet benefit of the continuous integration that comes with Azure Static Web Apps)
